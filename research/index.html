<p>My research targets safe autonomy against uncertainty and aims to build safe connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Over the past 5 years, I have been engaged in two lines of research, i.e., a scalable motion planning and control algorithm/software stack for high-level CAVs, and an AI-driven sensor-level augmented reality for efficient CAV tests. Some past projects are introduced below.</p>
<h5 id="1-intelligent-motion-planning">1. Intelligent Motion Planning</h5>
<p>This project aims to develop intelligent algorithms and software for automatic routing, decision making, and trajectory generation of self-driving vehicles. Both model-based and learning-based algorithms are explored for improved robustness and intelligence.</p>

<h6 id="21-design-analysis-and-experiments-of-preview-path-tracking-control">2.1) Design, Analysis, and Experiments of Preview Path Tracking Control</h6>
<p>How to achieve smooth, accurate, and computationally efficient steering control? We address this issue by developing a discrete-time preview steering controller, which considers vehicle dynamics and can smoothly deal with future road curvature. Its tracking performance is comparable to MPC but the computational load is greatly reduced due to its closed-form control law. Experiments on an automated Lincoln MKZ validated its improved tracking accuracy and smoothness. <a href="https://Shbing.github.io/papers/first-author/J7_Design-Analysis-and-Experiments-of-Preview-Path-Tracking-Control-for-Autonomous-Vehicles.pdf">Details</a></p>
<h6 id="22-safeguard-protected-preview-lane-keeping-control">2.2) Safeguard Protected Preview Lane Keeping Control</h6>
<p>How to bound tracking errors to a certain safe level for better safety? In this paper, we solve this challenge by designing a preview lane keeping control supervised by a safeguard controller. The safeguard controller intervenes in the preview control if and only if the tracking error is approaching the safety boundary. The proposed controls were implemented on a self-driving vehicle platform and tested on open roads and in the Mcity test facility. <a href="https://Shbing.github.io/papers/first-author/J9-Design-and-Experiments-of-Safeguard-Protected-Preview-Lane-Keeping-Control-for-Autonomous-Vehicles.pdf">Details</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986626">Link to video</a></p>
<h6 id="23-preview-path-tracking-control-with-delay-compensation">2.3) Preview Path Tracking Control With Delay Compensation</h6>
<p>Does your self-driving car run with unexpected slalom and steering oscillation? If yes, then one potential cause is the system time delay and steering lag. This paper targets this challenge and presents a delay-compensated preview steering control design, which can lower tracking errors and significantly improve stability margin compared to controls ignoring delay and lag. All the controller design, performance analysis, and experimental validation on a self-driving MKZ platform are detailed. <a href="https://Shbing.github.io/papers/first-author/J10-Preview-Path-Tracking-Control-With-Delay-Compensation-for-Autonomous-Vehicles.pdf">Details</a></p>

<p>How to smoothly and accurately track a planned speed profile considering the powertrain nonlinearity? Taking the Lincoln MKZ as an example, we designed two computationally efficient, smooth, and accurate speed-tracking control algorithms, i.e., 1) an optimal preview control if future information (reference speed and road slope) is provided a priori, and 2) a PID+C control if the information is unavailable. All controls are validated by the MKZ platform at Mcity. <a href="https://Shbing.github.io/papers/first-author/J8_Design-and-Test-of-Speed-Tracking-Control-for-the-Self-Driving-Lincoln-MKZ-Platform.pdf">Details</a></p>

<p>How to drive the vehicle with minimal fuel consumption? This project designed speed profile optimization algorithms and powertrain control strategies for self-driving vehicles with hybrid electric powertrain or conventional powertrain. Nonlinear constrained eco-driving problems are formulated and solved by Legendre pseudo-spectral method. If you are interested in how to use minimal fuel (energy) to accelerate a car, cruise on highways (for both conventional vehicles and HEV), and drive on varying slopes, please refer to the following papers for detailed algorithms, performance, and the underlying mechanisms.</p>
